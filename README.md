### Running code

 - If the program is written in C, a Makefile will be provided.  
 - If the script is written in Python, `$ python [name of program]` will typically work. If the script needs any parameter(s), those will be specified in the header comments of the `.py` file. Some new libraries may need to be installed using `pip`; those will be specified in the header comments of the script as well.
